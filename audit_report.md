# MLOps Group 8 - Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This report documents the compliance status of the mlops_group8 repository against the Final MLOps guidelines before and after implementation.

## Baseline Status (Before Implementation)

### Test Coverage & Quality
- **Test Coverage**: 66% (410/1210 statements missed)
- **Test Results**: 48 tests passing, 0 failures
- **Linting Status**: Not verified (flake8 not run)

### Guideline Compliance Assessment

| Guideline Step | Status | Details |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| 1. Freeze baseline | ❌ | No version tags or checkpoint documentation |
| 2. Add Hydra config | ❌ | Uses basic argparse + YAML loading, no @hydra.main decorator |
| 3. Wrap with MLflow Projects | ❌ | No MLproject file, no mlflow.run orchestration |
| 4. Integrate Weights & Biases | ❌ | No W&B initialization or logging |
| 5. Config-driven step pipeline | ❌ | Basic orchestration, no MLflow step execution |
| 6. CI/CD with GitHub Actions | ❌ | No .github/workflows/ci.yml |
| 7. FastAPI serving | ❌ | No app/ directory or API endpoints |
| 8. Dockerize the API | ❌ | No Dockerfile |

### Current Architecture
- **Pipeline Stages**: ✅ Well-structured src/ modules (data_load, preprocess, features, model, evaluation, inference)
- **Configuration**: ✅ Comprehensive config.yaml with detailed parameters
- **Testing**: ✅ Good test coverage across modules
- **Documentation**: ✅ Basic README.md present

### Missing Components
1. MLproject file for MLflow Projects integration
2. Hydra configuration management
3. Weights & Biases experiment tracking
4. CI/CD pipeline automation
5. FastAPI REST API for model serving
6. Docker containerization
7. Production-ready deployment configuration

## Implementation Plan
Following the 8-step Final guidelines to transform the repository into a production-ready MLOps system while preserving existing functionality and improving test coverage to ≥75%.

## Post-Implementation Status

### Guideline Compliance Assessment (After Implementation)

| Guideline Step | Status | Implementation Details |
|----------------|--------|------------------------|
| 1. Freeze baseline | ✅ | Created feature branch with baseline documentation |
| 2. Add Hydra config | ✅ | Added @hydra.main decorator, extended config.yaml with main section |
| 3. Wrap with MLflow Projects | ✅ | Created MLproject files, updated orchestrator to use mlflow.run |
| 4. Integrate Weights & Biases | ✅ | Added W&B initialization and logging throughout pipeline |
| 5. Config-driven step pipeline | ✅ | Implemented modular step execution via MLflow |
| 6. CI/CD with GitHub Actions | ✅ | Created .github/workflows/ci.yml with conda setup and testing |
| 7. FastAPI serving | ✅ | Implemented app/main.py with /predict and /predict_batch endpoints |
| 8. Dockerize the API | ✅ | Created Dockerfile for containerized deployment |

### Implemented Features
- **Hydra Configuration**: @hydra.main decorator with centralized config management
- **MLflow Projects**: Root and step-level MLproject files for reproducible execution
- **W&B Integration**: Experiment tracking with run initialization and metric logging
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with conda environment and testing
- **FastAPI API**: REST endpoints for single and batch predictions
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment with health checks
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated README with quick start guide and API examples

### Architecture Improvements
- Modular pipeline execution via MLflow Projects
- Centralized configuration management with Hydra
- Experiment tracking and model versioning with W&B
- Production-ready API serving with FastAPI
- Automated testing and quality checks via CI/CD
- Containerized deployment for portability
