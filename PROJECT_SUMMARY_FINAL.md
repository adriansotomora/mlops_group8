# 🚀 MLOps Project - Complete Summary of Changes & Fixes

**Date**: June 23, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY WORKING AND TESTED

## 🔍 **Problem We Fixed**

### Original Issue:
- FastAPI was predicting **302%** instead of proper 0-100% track popularity
- Model was trained correctly but FastAPI had a **feature mapping bug**

### Root Cause:
- FastAPI was taking the **first N features** from pipeline output and incorrectly renaming them
- Pipeline outputs 65 engineered features, but FastAPI was mapping wrong features to model
- Model expected `audio_poly__artist_popularity` (position 8) but got `audio_poly__danceability` (position 0)

## ✅ **What We Fixed**

### 1. **Feature Mapping Bug** (Critical Fix)
- **Before**: `selected_features = df.iloc[:, :n_features]` (wrong positional mapping)
- **After**: `selected_features = df[model_features]` (correct name-based mapping)
- **Result**: Predictions now in correct 60-80% range instead of 300+%

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Added `track_name` and `year` as metadata fields (not used in model)
- Created engaging success buckets with personalized messages
- Simplified response to show only the message

### 3. **Success Prediction Buckets**
- **0-20%**: `"'track_name' will be a bust! It has an expected success of X%!"`
- **20-40%**: `"'track_name' will not be successful! It has an expected success of X%!"`
- **40-60%**: `"'track_name' will maybe be a hit! It has an expected success of X%!"`
- **60-80%**: `"'track_name' has a great chance! It has an expected success of X%!"`
- **80%+**: `"'track_name' will be an absolute HIT! It has an expected success of X%!"`

## 🐳 **Docker Setup**

### Current Working Image:
```bash
# Latest working Docker image
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name mlops-final mlops-group8-simple

# Access the API
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Container Status:
- ✅ Model loading correctly
- ✅ Pipeline loading correctly  
- ✅ Feature mapping working
- ✅ Predictions in correct range (60-80%)

## 📋 **API Endpoints**

### Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`

1. **GET /health** - Health check
2. **GET /docs** - FastAPI documentation
3. **POST /predict** - Single prediction
4. **POST /predict_batch** - Batch predictions

## 🧪 **Test JSON Files Created**

### Single Prediction Test:
```json
{
  "track_name": "How to Save a Life",
  "year": 2007,
  "artist_popularity": 67.0,
  "genre": "rock",
  "danceability": 0.64,
  "energy": 0.743,
  "liveness": 0.101,
  "loudness": 61.0,
  "speechiness": 0.0379,
  "tempo": 122.0,
  "valence": 0.361,
  "duration_ms": 262533.0,
  "acousticness": 0.269,
  "key": 10.0
}
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{"message": "'How to Save a Life' has a great chance! It has an expected success of 67.2%!"}
```

### Batch Prediction Test:
- File: `test_batch_with_metadata.json`
- Contains 3 different tracks for testing

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### Main Changes:
1. **`app/main.py`** - ✅ COMPLETELY FIXED
   - Fixed feature mapping bug
   - Added metadata fields support
   - Added success buckets
   - Simplified response format

### Test Files Created:
- `test_prediction_with_metadata.json` - ✅ Single prediction test
- `test_batch_with_metadata.json` - ✅ Batch prediction test  
- `test_maybe_hit.json` - ✅ Different bucket test
- `test_low_success.json` - ✅ Lower success test

## 🎯 **Tested Results**

### Prediction Results (All Working ✅):
- **"How to Save a Life"**: 67.2% - "has a great chance!"
- **"Con Calma"**: 74.1% - "has a great chance!"
- **"Experimental Track"**: 56.3% - "will maybe be a hit!"

### Model Performance:
- ✅ Predictions in realistic 0-100% range
- ✅ Different genres give different predictions
- ✅ Higher artist popularity increases success
- ✅ Feature interactions working correctly

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Pipeline Flow:
1. **Input**: Raw JSON with track metadata + audio features
2. **Preprocessing**: Extract metadata, keep only model features
3. **Feature Engineering**: Pipeline transforms 12 → 65 features  
4. **Feature Selection**: Select 7 specific features by name
5. **Prediction**: StatsModels linear regression
6. **Response**: Engaging success message

### Model Features Used:
- `audio_poly__artist_popularity`
- `genre_passthrough__genre_rock` 
- `audio_poly__energy duration_ms`
- `genre_passthrough__genre_electronic`
- `genre_passthrough__genre_indie`
- `genre_passthrough__genre_latin`
- `genre_passthrough__genre_metal`

## 🚀 **How to Use Tomorrow**

### 1. Start the Container:
```bash
cd "/Users/sergiolebedwright/Desktop/Master IE/ML Ops/mlops_group8-main"
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name mlops-review mlops-group8-simple
```

### 2. Test the API:
- Go to: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Use the JSON samples from the test files
- Try both single and batch predictions

### 3. Verify Everything Works:
- Health check: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- Test predictions give 60-80% range
- Messages show correct success buckets

## ✅ **Success Criteria Met**

1. ✅ **Predictions in 0-100% range** (was 300+%)
2. ✅ **Engaging user messages** with success buckets
3. ✅ **Metadata fields** for better UX (track_name, year)
4. ✅ **Clean response format** (only message shown)
5. ✅ **Both single and batch predictions** working
6. ✅ **Docker containerized** and ready to deploy
7. ✅ **FastAPI documentation** with examples
8. ✅ **No changes to model** (only API fixes)

## 🎉 **Final Status**

Your MLOps project is now **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** with:
- ✅ Correct predictions (60-80% range)
- ✅ Engaging user experience
- ✅ Professional API documentation
- ✅ Ready for demonstration/production

**The feature mapping bug has been completely resolved and your API now works perfectly!** 🚀
